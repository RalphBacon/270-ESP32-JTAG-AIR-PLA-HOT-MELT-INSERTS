### Lightweight PLA Filament  
A new (to me) 3D filament that has been foamed (prexpanded) to make it only 80% the weight of standard PLA/PLA+.  
OVERTURE PLA Filament 1.75mm,AIR PLA,Filament PLA 0.8kg Spool, Dimensional Accuracy +/-0.03mm, Fit Most FDM Printer (Many Colours)

### Hot Melt Brass Inserts  
An improved set of Hot Melt Brass Inserts for screwing your Arduino case together more neatly using this tool.

### JTAG settings for ESP32 WROOM / WROVER modules  
Last, but certainly not least, I've include the extra lines you need for your platformio.ini file to enable JTAG debugging of your ESP32:  
Put ONE of these (depending on your board, obvs) in the file.
```
board_debug.openocd_board = esp32-wroom-kit-3.3v.cfg
board_debug.openocd_board = esp-wroom-32.cfg
board_debug.openocd_board = esp32-wrover.cfg
```
I've now been able to use JTAG debugging on **ALL** my boards without issue. Fun times!
