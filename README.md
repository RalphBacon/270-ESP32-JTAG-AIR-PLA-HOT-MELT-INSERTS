### Lightweight PLA Filament  
A collection of Hints & Tips today starting with a new (to me) 3D filament that has been foamed (prexpanded) to make it only 80% the weight of standard PLA/PLA+.

### JTAG settings for ESP32 WROOM / WROVER modules  
Last, but certainly not least, I've include the extra lines you need for your platformio.ini file to enable JTAG debugging of your ESP32:  
Put ONE of these (depending on your board, obvs) in the file.
```
board_debug.openocd_board = esp32-wroom-kit-3.3v.cfg
board_debug.openocd_board = esp-wroom-32.cfg
board_debug.openocd_board = esp32-wrover.cfg
```
I've now been able to use JTAG debugging on **ALL** my boards without issue. Fun times!
